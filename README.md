### What I learned

I learned how to resize fontawesome icons, how to fill the white space beneath the footer, and how to style forms.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp) - This helped to show me how to style forms and change width and height.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/size) - This article by FontAwesome themselves helped to explain how to resize their icons.
- [generatepress.com](https://generatepress.com/forums/topic/fill-footer-color-to-bottom-of-page/) - This forum gave a good tip on how to fill the white space I had beneath the footer in mobile view where the body background color was showing through.
